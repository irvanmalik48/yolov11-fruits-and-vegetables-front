# Project Arienne

A YOLOv11 Fruits and Vegetables Classification Frontend repository.
Made to satisfy my final thesis assessment.

## Running on local

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irvanmalik48/arienne
```

2. Install dependencies:

I use `pnpm` for the package management and advise you to do so as well.
But this advice is more of an optional errand rather than a mandatory one
so use whatever package management you desire.

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Running dev server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
